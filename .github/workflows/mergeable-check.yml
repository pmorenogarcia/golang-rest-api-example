                This PR requires the following before it can be merged:

                1. ✅ Code review from Claude (automatic)
                2. ✅ All CI checks passing
                3. ⏳ **\`mergeable\` label** (add this after review is complete)

                Once all requirements are met, a maintainer should add the \`mergeable\` label to allow merging.

                ---
                *This is part of the mergeable workflow. See [CLAUDE_SETUP.md](../.github/CLAUDE_SETUP.md) for details.*`
              });
            }
